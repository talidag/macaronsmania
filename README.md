Welcome to my project repository! Here, I've taken inspiration from a Figma design and brought it to life using HTML and CSS. I paid close attention to every detail to make sure the website looks just like the design.

Key Learnings:

* **Figma Design Implementation**: I've learned how to take a picture of what a website should look like and actually build it using code. This helped me understand how to bring ideas to life on the web. ([Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/W195iTcMZ5LhzGedc5VIXd/Landing-Page-for-a-pastry-shop%2C-call-Macaronsmania-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=NdXkScK4AagO7S2c-0)) <br />
* **CSS Positioning Mastery**: Throughout the project, I deepened my understanding of CSS positioning, particularly position: absolute and position: relative, to achieve pixel-perfect layouts. <br />
* **Atomic Design Structure**: I structured the components following the Atomic Design methodology, creating a hierarchy of atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This modular approach improved code organization and reusability.<br />
* **Styling Superpowers with SCSS**: Instead of writing plain CSS, I used SCSS. It's like having styling superpowers! SCSS let me reuse styles, organize my code better, and keep everything looking awesome. <br />

**Shout-Outs** <br>

Big thanks to Figma for helping me design and plan everything, and to the creators of Atomic Design for the cool way of organizing stuff.

Feel free to explore my code and use it to make your own websites. If you have any questions or thoughts, you can reach me at talida.ganciu@gmail.com.
